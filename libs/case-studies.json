The original layout was overwhelming, and users struggled with fragmented navigation, particularly on mobile. As the lead designer, I aimed to modernize the page by prioritizing job listings, streamlining filters, and improving mobile functionality. The solution involved transitioning to a single-column job card layout, creating a clearer visual hierarchy, and refining the search and filter experience. We added strategic callouts like top-matching jobs and premium ads, ensuring a more cohesive and engaging experience. These changes led to improved user focus and engagement across both desktop and mobile platforms.",
