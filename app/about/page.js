      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        With a strong foundation in front-end development and a creative eye for
        design, I bring digital experiences to life through clean code and
        intuitive interfaces. Front End Developer and Web Designer with hands-on
        experience designing and developing responsive websites for the ATTB
        Group. I focus on creating visually engaging, user-friendly websites
        that prioritize functionality, accessibility, and performanceâ€”always
        aligned with best practices and SEO standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to my current role, I completed a Diploma in Full Stack Software
        Development with Code Institute, where I discovered a strong drive for
        problem-solving and building seamless user experiences. This foundation
        has enabled me to write clean, maintainable, and reusable code using
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and confidently review and optimize front-end
        performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my current position, I design visuals, graphics, and user interfaces
        while ensuring mobile responsiveness and W3C compliance. I regularly
        monitor site performance and accessibility, and I use tools like Adobe
        Creative Suite along with basic scripting to enhance functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I&apos;m a curious and creative individual with a love
        for Japanese culture, anime, and gaming. I enjoy knitting, drawing, and
        cooking, and I find inspiration in everything from beautifully designed
        interfaces to a great cup of coffee. These passions fuel my creativity
        and attention to detail in everything I build.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m excited to continue growing as a Front End Developer, bringing
        thoughtful design and clean code together to craft engaging digital
        experiences.
